## Credit Card Applications Dataset

This dataset was obtained from the **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/143/statlog+australian+credit+approval)**.

### Description
This dataset concerns credit card applications. All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect the confidentiality of the data.

This dataset is interesting because it contains a mix of attributesâ€”both continuous and nominal with varying numbers of values. Additionally, there are a few missing values. 

There are:
- **6 numerical** attributes
- **8 categorical** attributes

The labels have been modified for statistical algorithms. For instance, attribute 4 originally had the labels `p`, `g`, and `gg`, which have been changed to `1`, `2`, and `3`.
